Libraries
------------------------------
To build, the project requires the following libraries:

1) SDL2
==============
Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access 
to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

2) glew-2.0.0
==============
https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/2.0.0/
The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform C/C++ library that helps in 
querying and loading OpenGL extensions. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining 
which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform. All OpenGL extensions are exposed in 
a single header file, which is machine-generated from the official extension list. 
GLEW is available for a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, 
FreeBSD, IRIX, and Solaris. 

3) glm
==============
OpenGL  Mathematics  (GLM),  accessed  December  2017,  http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html
GLM is a C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) 
specification. GLM provides classes and basic math functions related to graphics concepts, 
such as vector, matrix, and quaternion. 


4) freetype
==============
https://github.com/ubawurinna/freetype-windows-binaries/tree/master/release%20dll/win64
FreeType is a popular software development library used to render text onto bitmaps, and provides 
support for other font-related operations.
